## Requirements
This implementation is based on [PyTorch](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (tested for version 1.7.0). Please refer to [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for the other required packages and version.  

## Datasets
The implementation supports the following datasets:
- [Adult](), [Census](), [News](), and [Texas]()

You can download the data by running the notebooks in `data/<dataset_name>/<dataset_name>-download.ipynb`.

## Running Experiments
### API (Run experiments using the default configurations).
```main
cd source
python main.py \
--dataset "Dataset name" \
--method "Defense method" \
--mode "Experiment mode" \
[--model "Model architecture"(used only for CIFAR datasets)] \ 
```
- Set the `"Defense methods"` to be `'relaxloss'` to run our method.  
- The following defense methods are supported: 
`'vanilla', 'relaxloss', 'advreg', 'dpsgd', 'confidence_penalty', 'distillation', 'dropout', 'early_stopping', 'label_smoothing'`.
And `'vanilla'` corresponds to no defense baseline.
- The following `"Experiment modes"` are supported: 
  - `'defense'`: run the defense method to train a target model.
  - `'attack'`:  evaluate the target model under different MIAs (it requires to run defense first).
  - `'shadow'`: run the defense method to train a shadow model.
  - `'defense_attack'`: run the defense method to train a target model and directly evaluate the trained target model under different MIAs.
- For CIFAR datasets, default configurations support `'resnet20'` and `'vgg11_bn'` models. 

### Run defense with specific configurations.
- Go into folder `source/cifar/defense` or `source/nonimage/defense` depends on the dataset.
- You can run each defense with command 
    ```defense
    python 'Defense_name'.py \
    -name "Experiment name (output folder name)" \
    --dataset "Dataset name" \
    [--model "Model architecture"(for CIFAR datasets)] \ 
    ```
   and specify the arguments in command-lines. Please refer to the `parse_arguments()` function in each python file for more details.
 
### Run attacks.
- Go into folder `source/cifar` or `source/nonimage` depends on the dataset.
- Run attacks by providing the directory that contains the `'model.pt'` file. 
    ``` 
    python run_attacks.py -target "Target_MODELDIR" -shadow "Shadow_MODELDIR"  
    ```
- In the current implementation, the attack `ACC`(accuracy) and `AUC`(area under the ROC curve) are evaluated.
- The following attacks are supported. Please refer to `'source\utils\attack.py` for more details.
    - `'NN','Confidence','Loss','Entropy','Modified-Entorpy` (Black-box)
    - `'grad_wrt_x_l1', 'grad_wrt_x_l2', 'grad_wrt_w_l1', 'grad_wrt_w_l2'` (White-box)
